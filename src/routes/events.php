| EVENTS Routes - by BaraaDark
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| Here you can write your events logic as a Laravel route. Each route
| defined here will correspond to two Socket.IO events: a 'fetch' event
| for fetching data and a 'load' event for loading data. The event names
| will be the same as the route name but with 'fetch/' or 'load/' prefixed
| to it.
|
| Example:
| Route::get('students/index', [SocketController::class, 'index']);
| - 'fetch/students/index' event for fetching data.
| - 'load/students/index' event for loading data.
|
| Note: All routes in this file have the 'socket' prefix.
|
| Important: The route action should return JSON data.
| Example:
| return response()->json([
|    ...
|
|    'data' => $your_data,
|
|    ...
| ]);
|
|
| Dont Forget to run php artisan socket:events after updating this file
|

// Write your routes here ..
